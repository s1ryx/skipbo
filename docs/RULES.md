# Skip-Bo Game Rules

## Objective

The goal of Skip-Bo is to be the first player to play all the cards in your stockpile. You do this by building sequential piles of cards in numerical order (from 1 to 12) in the center of the table. The game ends when one player has no cards left in their stockpile.

## What You Need

- **Skip-Bo Cards**: A deck that includes numbers from 1 to 12 and "Skip-Bo" cards, which act as wild cards
- **Players**: 2 to 6 players

## Setting Up the Game

### 1. Shuffle the Cards
Mix the deck thoroughly so the cards are in random order.

### 2. Deal Cards

**Stockpile:**
- Each player gets a stockpile of **30 cards** if there are 2-4 players
- Each player gets a stockpile of **20 cards** if there are 5-6 players
- Cards are dealt face down in a stack in front of you
- **Do not look at these cards!**

**Hand:**
- After the stockpile is dealt, each player gets **5 cards** to hold in their hand
- Keep these cards face up where you can see them

**Building Piles:**
- Set up **four central piles** where players will build sequences of 1-12
- These building piles are shared by all players

### 3. Card Order
- Arrange your stockpile in a face-down pile (one card on top)
- Your hand of 5 cards should be placed face-up where you can see them

## Types of Cards

### Number Cards (1-12)
Regular cards that must be played in ascending order on the building piles.

### Skip-Bo Cards (Wild Cards)
- Can represent any number from 1 to 12
- Help you complete sequences in the building piles
- Can be played whenever needed to continue a sequence

### Building Piles
- Four piles in the center of the table
- Must start with a **1** and go up to **12**
- Cards must be placed in ascending order
- Once a pile reaches 12, it is complete and removed

## How to Play

### Starting Your Turn

1. **Draw cards** from the deck until you have 5 cards in your hand
2. **Play cards** from:
   - Your hand
   - Top card of your stockpile
   - Top cards of your discard piles

### Building Piles Rules

- Build from **1 to 12** in ascending order
- The **1** is the starting card for each pile
- After a 1, place a 2, then 3, and so on until you reach 12
- **Wild cards (Skip-Bo)** can represent any number
- Once a building pile reaches **12**, it is finished and removed from play

### Playing from Your Stockpile

- You can **only play the top card** of your stockpile
- You cannot look at cards below the top card
- If the top card is playable, you should try to play it

### Using Discard Piles

- Each player has **4 discard piles** beside their stockpile
- At the **end of each turn**, you must discard one card from your hand to one of your discard piles
- Discard piles can be built in any order (no numerical sequence required)
- On future turns, you can play the **top card** from any of your discard piles

### Mid-Turn Draw

- If your hand becomes **empty during your turn**, you automatically draw **5 more cards** from the deck
- This allows you to continue playing without ending your turn

### Ending Your Turn

1. You **must discard one card** from your hand to one of your discard piles
2. You cannot skip the discard phase
3. Turn passes to the next player

## Sequence Rules

- Cards must be placed in **ascending order** (1, 2, 3, etc.) on building piles
- You **cannot skip a number** in the sequence
- If there's no 1 to start a pile, you can't add anything to it
- Once a building pile reaches **12**, it is finished and removed from play
- A new pile can be started with a 1

## Skip-Bo Wild Cards

- Can be used as **any number** in a sequence
- Example: If you need a 4, you can play a Skip-Bo as the 4
- Can be played from your hand, stockpile top, or discard pile tops
- If a Skip-Bo is the top card of your stockpile, you can play it as a 1 to start a new pile

## Winning the Game

The **first player to empty their stockpile** wins the game!

If two players empty their stockpiles at the same time, the one who played their last card first is the winner.

## Important Rules

- **No Peeking**: You cannot look at your stockpile cards except the top card
- **Strategy with Discard Piles**: Keep track of cards in your discard piles that could help build sequences in the future
- **Mandatory Discard**: You must always discard one card to end your turn

## Example Turn

### Player 1's Turn:

1. Starts by looking at their hand (5 cards)
2. Checks if any cards can be played on the central building piles
3. Plays a **3** from their hand onto a building pile
4. Plays a **Skip-Bo** card as a **4** to continue the sequence
5. Plays a **5** from their stockpile
6. At the end of the turn, discards a card from their hand to one of their discard piles

### Player 2's Turn:

1. Plays a **1** from their stockpile onto an empty building pile
2. Unable to make any more plays
3. Discards a card at the end of their turn
4. Play passes to the next player

# Skip-Bo Card Game

A multiplayer Skip-Bo card game built with React and Node.js using Socket.IO for real-time communication.

## Tech Stack

### Backend

- **Node.js** - Server runtime
- **Express** - Web framework
- **Socket.IO** - Real-time bidirectional communication

### Frontend

- **React** - UI library
- **Socket.IO Client** - Real-time communication client
- **CSS3** - Styling with animations

## Game Rules

Be the first player to empty your stockpile by building sequential piles
(1–12) in the center. Players take turns drawing, playing cards from hand,
stockpile, or discard piles, and discarding a card to end their turn. Skip-Bo
cards are wild. For complete rules, see [docs/RULES.md](docs/RULES.md).

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### 1. Install Server Dependencies

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

### 2. Install Client Dependencies

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

## Running the Game

### Local Development (Single Machine)

#### 1. Start the Server

```bash
cd server
npm start
```

The server will run on `http://localhost:3001`

For development with auto-reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

#### 2. Start the Client

In a new terminal:

```bash
cd client
npm start
```

The client will run on `http://localhost:3000` and open automatically in your browser.

## Local Network Play

To play with others on the same WiFi/LAN without Docker:

1. Find your local IP (`ipconfig` on Windows, `hostname -I` on Linux/macOS)
2. Set `HOST=0.0.0.0` and `CORS_ORIGIN=*` in `server/.env`
3. Set `REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=http://<your-ip>:3001` in `client/.env`
4. Start the server (`cd server && npm start`) and client (`cd client && npm run build && npx serve -s build -l 3000`)
5. Other players open `http://<your-ip>:3000` in their browser

You may need to allow ports 3000 and 3001 through your firewall. For anything beyond quick local testing, Docker deployment is easier and more reliable.

---

## Docker Deployment (Recommended)

For production deployment or internet play, use Docker for containerized deployment with optimized performance and security.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (v20.10+)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v2.0+)

### Quick Start with Docker

1. **Clone or navigate to the project**:

```bash
cd skip-bo-game
```

2. **Build and start all services**:

```bash
cd deployment/docker
docker-compose up -d
```

This will:

- Build the client and server Docker images
- Start nginx reverse proxy on port 80
- Configure all networking and health checks automatically

3. **Access the game**:

- Local: `http://localhost`
- Network: `http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS` (find IP with `hostname -I` or `ipconfig`)

4. **View logs**:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

5. **Stop the services**:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Architecture

The Docker setup includes:

- **Client**: React app served by nginx (optimized production build)
- **Server**: Node.js Socket.IO server with health checks
- **Nginx Reverse Proxy**: Routes traffic and handles WebSocket connections
- **Docker Network**: Isolated bridge network for service communication

```
Internet/LAN
    ↓
nginx (port 80)
    ├── / → client (React app)
    ├── /socket.io/ → server (WebSocket)
    └── /api/ → server (REST endpoints)
```

### Configuration

#### Production Environment Variables

For production deployment, create environment files:

**Server** (`server/.env.production`):

```env
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3001
HOST=0.0.0.0
CORS_ORIGIN=*  # Change to your domain in production
```

**Client** (`client/.env.production`):

```env
# Leave empty for same-origin Socket.IO connection (recommended)
REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=
```

#### Custom Domain Setup

To use a custom domain:

1. Point your domain's DNS A record to your server's IP
2. Update `CORS_ORIGIN` in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
environment:
  - CORS_ORIGIN=https://yourdomain.com
```

3. For HTTPS, add SSL certificates to nginx configuration

### Deployment Platforms

#### Deploy to Cloud Platforms

The Docker setup works with any container platform:

**Railway.app**:

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

**Render.com**:

- Connect your GitHub repository
- Select "Docker" as environment
- Set root directory to `deployment/docker`
- Render will auto-detect `docker-compose.yml`

**Fly.io**:

```bash
# Install flyctl
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh

# Deploy
fly launch
fly deploy
```

**DigitalOcean/AWS/GCP**:

- Deploy to any VPS with Docker installed
- Use docker-compose as shown above
- Configure firewall to allow port 80/443

### Production Best Practices

1. **HTTPS/SSL**: Use a reverse proxy like Cloudflare or Let's Encrypt certificates
2. **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` files with secrets
3. **CORS**: Update `CORS_ORIGIN` to your specific domain (not `*`)
4. **Monitoring**: Use `docker-compose logs` or integrate with logging services
5. **Backups**: No database needed - game state is in-memory
6. **Scaling**: For multiple instances, add a Redis adapter for Socket.IO

### Troubleshooting Docker Deployment

**Build fails:**

```bash
# Clear Docker cache and rebuild
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

**Services won't start:**

```bash
# Check logs for specific service
docker-compose logs server
docker-compose logs client
docker-compose logs nginx
```

**Can't connect:**

- ✅ Verify all containers are running: `docker-compose ps`
- ✅ Check health status: `docker-compose ps` (should show "healthy")
- ✅ Ensure port 80 is not in use: `sudo lsof -i :80`
- ✅ Check firewall allows port 80: `sudo ufw status`

**WebSocket connection fails:**

- ✅ Verify nginx is proxying correctly: `docker-compose logs nginx`
- ✅ Check browser console for connection errors
- ✅ Ensure CORS_ORIGIN is set correctly

Objective of the Game:

The goal of Skip-Bo is to be the first player to play all the cards in your stockpile (the stack of cards you start with). You do this by building sequential piles of cards in numerical order (from 1 to 12) in the center of the table. The game ends when one player has no cards left in their stockpile.

What You Need:

Skip-Bo Cards: The game comes with a deck of cards that includes numbers from 1 to 12 and "Skip-Bo" cards, which act as wild cards.

Players: 2 to 6 players.

Setting Up the Game:

Shuffle the Cards: Mix the deck thoroughly so the cards are in random order.

Deal Cards:

Stockpile: Each player gets a stockpile of 30 cards if there are 2-4 players, or 20 cards if there are 5-6 players. You should have this many cards dealt face down in a stack in front of you. Do not look at these cards!

Hand: After the stockpile is dealt, each player gets 5 cards to hold in their hand, face up. This is the hand you will use to play cards on your turn.

Building Piles: Set up four central piles where players will build their sequences of 1-12. These are the building piles, which everyone can use to play their cards onto during the game.

Card Order: Arrange your stockpile in a face-down pile (one card on top), and your hand of 5 cards should be placed face-up where you can see them.

Types of Cards in the Deck:

Number Cards (1-12): These are the regular cards. When playing cards on the building piles, the numbers must be played in ascending order (from 1 to 12).

Skip-Bo Cards: These are wild cards that can represent any number from 1 to 12, and they help you complete a sequence in the building piles.

Building Piles: These are piles of cards in the center of the table where players will play cards. Each pile must start with a 1 and can go up to 12, with cards placed in ascending order.

How to Play the Game:
1. Starting the Game (Player's Turn):

Draw 5 cards from your stockpile if you don’t have enough cards in your hand.

Play Cards: You can play cards from your hand, stockpile, or discard piles onto the central building piles.

Building Piles: You build from 1 to 12. The 1s are the starting cards for each pile. After a 1 is placed on a building pile, the next card in that pile must be the 2, then the 3, and so on until you reach 12. A building pile ends at 12, and no more cards can be played on that pile.

Wild Cards (Skip-Bo): Wild cards can represent any number, so you can play them to complete any sequence (e.g., if there is a 5, and the next card needed is a 6, you can use a Skip-Bo as the 6).

Stockpile: You can only play the top card of your stockpile on your turn.

Discard Piles: You can also play cards to the discard piles. At the end of your turn, you must place one card face-up in your discard pile.

2. Sequence Rules:

Cards must be placed in ascending order (1, 2, 3, etc.) on the building piles. For example, if a 3 is on a building pile, the next card you can play there must be a 4.

You cannot skip a number. If there’s no 1 to start a pile, you can’t add anything to it.

Once a building pile reaches 12, it is "finished." You can start a new pile with a 1.

3. Playing the Stockpile:

On your turn, if the top card of your stockpile is playable (meaning it can be placed on one of the building piles), you must play it. You cannot skip over any card in your stockpile.

Card Limitations: You are only allowed to play the top card of your stockpile on any turn.

4. Using the Discard Piles:

Each player can have up to 3 discard piles beside their stockpile. At the end of each turn, you must discard one card from your hand to one of your discard piles.

Discard piles are built in any order (you don’t have to build numerically).

On future turns, you can use cards from your discard piles to help you build the building piles, just like cards from your hand.

5. Skip-Bo Cards (Wild Cards):

A Skip-Bo card can be used as any number in a sequence (for example, if you need a 4, you can play a Skip-Bo as the 4).

You can play a Skip-Bo card whenever it’s your turn and you need it to continue building a sequence.

Skip-Bo Cards in Stockpile: If you have a Skip-Bo card as the top card of your stockpile, you can play it as a 1 to start a new building pile or as part of an existing pile.

6. End of Your Turn:

End by discarding: At the end of each turn, discard one card from your hand to one of your discard piles.

If you have played all the cards in your hand and stockpile, you can skip the discard phase.

Winning the Game:

The first player to empty their stockpile (get rid of all their stockpile cards) wins the game!

If two players empty their stockpiles at the same time, the one who played their last card first is the winner.

Additional Important Rules:

No Peeking: You cannot look at your stockpile cards unless they are the top card of the pile.

Strategy with Discard Piles: Don’t forget about your discard piles. Keep an eye on cards in your discard pile that could help you continue building sequences in the future.

Example of a Turn:

Player 1’s turn:

They start by looking at their hand (5 cards) and see if they can play anything from it onto the central piles.

They play a 3 from their hand onto a building pile, followed by a Skip-Bo card, using it as a 4, then a 5 from their stockpile.

At the end of the turn, they discard a card from their hand to one of their discard piles.

Player 2’s turn:

They play a 1 from their stockpile onto an empty building pile.

They discard a card at the end of their turn and wait for the next round.
